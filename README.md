# Breathing Problem Classification using CNN

## Overview

In this Project, we use CNN on X-rays and CT scan images of various patients from across the world [Cohen, Joseph Paul, et al. "Covid-19 image data collection: Prospective predictions are the future." arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.11988 (2020).](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11597.pdf) to predict various breathing diseases they. A total of 28 breathing issues are there including. We have treated the problem as a multilabel classification problem here as a single patient often have more than one disease.
